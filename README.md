# Pay with Terra with CF worker

The goal was to create a simple webhook function to deal with accepting payments with Terra from anywhere really, and to be my real first web3 project.

There is still a lot of functionality that needs to be done, like accounting for the [Second Check](https://paywithterra.com/docs/api#second-check) and removing orders that haven't been paid or completed.

### How to run?

```cli
pnpm i
```

## Commands

```cli
pnpm dev      Starts development in watch mode
pnpm build    Runs a production build
```
